/*
Write a C program that reverses a sentence, provided by the user, using recursion (the function calls itself).

NOTE:
1. MUST use a recursive function
2. If reading individual characters:
   - use getchar() instead of scanf() - or you might run into segmentation faults with auto-grading
   - to end recursion, check if the character is EOF (end of file character) - or you might run into segmentation faults with auto-grading
3. Display just the reverse of the sentence on a single line

Example:
Enter a sentence: awesome possum
mussop emosewa
